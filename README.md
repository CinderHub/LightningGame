LightningGame
=============

A reaction based HTML5 game for iOS.

Lightning game is an action based game where the player takes on the role of a spirit defending itself from being corrupted by demons in the middle of a thunderstorm. The player is a full white figure against a black background, and the art style is similar to the style seen here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmkxsQnNujI

Once the player starts the game, red demon eyes can be seen against the black background, and the player must defeat the demons, for if too many demons remain on screen the player will start to fill up with red, as they slowly get corrupted by the demons. Every demon the player kills will reduce the red, and make the player more white again. If the player lets too many demons remain on screen for too long, the player will become fully red and will join the demons, and the player will have to start again.

There will be different types of demons that will appear and they will come in an increasingly larger amount as the player defeats more demons, making the game more and more frantic in nature as the player fights to prevent being corrupted. Every time the player kills a demon, the screen will go from white to black in alternating forms, showing to the player the location of the demons, as the thunderclap from the player killing a demon illuminates the screen.

As seen in the video, there could also be beams of white light that move across the screen, occassionally showing a hint to the player as to where some of the demons are, and if the player is corrupted, being in the white light could potentially help purify the player as well for as long as they are in the light.

Demons could be killed by having the player have to swipe from specific angles with the demons being invulnerable to attacks from other angles, and demons could have a state where they turn red for a moment of time, and if the player kills the demon during this time while the demon will be killed the player will turn even more red, so it is important that the player time their kills carefully.

Certain demon types could also take more hits to kill, prolonging the time a player takes to purify themselves. The potential for a powerup that would instantly purify the player and kill all demons on screen also exists.
